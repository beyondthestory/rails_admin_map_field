Rails Admin Map Field
=====================

rails_admin_map_field is a gem that works with sferik's **rails_admin** (https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin) to provide an easy to use Google Maps interface for displaying and setting geographic co-ordinates in a model.

Where a latitude and longitude is set on the model, it is indicated by a marker shown on a Google map centered at the marker. The administrator can change the value of these fields by clicking on the desired new location on the map.

Usage
=====

rails_admin_map_field expects that the model will have two attributes, one for latitude and one for longitude of the point represented. To enable rails_admin_map_field, add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "rails_admin_map_field", :git => "git://github.com/beyondthestory/rails_admin_map_field.git"
```

Then, add in your `config/initializers/rails_admin.rb` initializer:

```ruby
RailsAdmin.config do |config|
  config.model User do
    edit do
      field :latitude, :map
    end
  end
end
```

**Note**: The field which is set as a map-type field must be the latitude field, not the longitude. By default, rails_admin_map_field will guess that the longitude field is called "longitude".

Configuration
=============

For different configurations, rails_admin_map_field can be configured with the following:

- `longitude_field` - the name of the longitude field that forms the the co-ordinate with the latitude field specified. Defaults to "longitude"
- `google_api_key` - if you use a Google Maps API Key, it can be specified here.
- `default_latitude` - the latitude to center the map shown on if the latitude field is blank. Defaults to 51.5, the latitude of London, UK.
- `default_longitude` - the longitude used if the longitude field is blank. Defaults to -0.126, the longitude of London, UK.

A more complicated configuration example:

```ruby
RailsAdmin.config do |config|
  config.model Point do
    edit do
      field :lat, :map do
        longitude_field :lon
        google_api_key "a1b2c3d4e5f6deadbeef"
        default_latitude -34.0  # Sydney, Australia
        default_longitude 151.0
      end
    end
  end
end
```
